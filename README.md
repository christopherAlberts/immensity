# immensity()
An encryption function built on the same math used in mathematical constants like the Fibonacci sequence, the twin prime constant and the base of the natural logarithm, to name but a few.

The idea behind the *immensity* function, was to create a strong light weight encryption function that can easily be used in future code. So the *immensity* function is designd to either encrypt existing string variables, or it can be given a file path and then read text from the file in question. Following this the function is build so it can decrypt the messages as well.

## How It Works ##

Going about encrypting text espesialy with the use of a computer is quite simple. If however you're not that fomilular with how a computer deals with the string datatype i.e. *text*. Here is a quick computer science theory lesson. 

Computers can only understand numbers. In order to represente letters and other unique characters we make use of the ASCII table. ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort such as *"Ens"* or *"Tab"*.
