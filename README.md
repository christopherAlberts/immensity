# immensity()
An encryption function built on the same math used in mathematical constants like the Fibonacci sequence, the twin prime constant and the base of the natural logarithm, to name but a few.

The idea behind the *immensity* function, was to create a strong light weight encryption function that can easily be used in future code. So the *immensity* function is designd to either encrypt existing string variables, or it can be given a file path and then read text from the file in question. Following this the function is build so it can decrypt the messages as well.

## How It Works ##

Going about encrypting text espesialy with the use of a computer is quite simple. If however you're not that fomilular with how a computer deals with the string datatype i.e. *text*. Here is a quick computer science theory lesson.
